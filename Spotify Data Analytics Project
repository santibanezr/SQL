* For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle. Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into. Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.*

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
);

*Data was imported using a CSV file*

*What are the top 20 tracks based on danceability? Since I am not very hip, I need to find out who sings those songs as well*
    SELECT track_name, artist_name, danceability
    FROM Spotifydata
    ORDER BY danceability desc
    LIMIT 20;

*Who are the artists with more than one song in the top list and what is their average danceability? 
SELECT count(track_name) songsinTop, artist_name, avg(danceability) 
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING count(artist_name)>1
ORDER BY dancing desc;

*What are the top 10 artists by energy level? Who performs the most energetic song?*
SELECT artist_name, count(artist_name) tracksonTopList, avg(energy) energy
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY energy desc
LIMIT 10;

SELECT artist_name, max(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata

*Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.*

WITH popTable AS(
SELECT s.artist_name,AVG(s.popularity) AS pop
FROM Spotifydata s
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)
SELECT artist_name,pop, 'Top Star' AS Tag
FROM popTable
WHERE pop>=90;
